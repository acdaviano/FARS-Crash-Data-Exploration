# FARS-Texas-Crash-Data-Exploration
This repository is about my exploration of the Texas crash Data from FARS. This was all a large real-world project that had 2 parts to it.

Conclusions were made in the blog write-ups. This was an exploration of pedestrian fatalities in the state of Texas as they pertained to the crash data for that state recently. We find some interesting insight into what factors are most important contributers to the vehicle crash deaths. The codes to the projects on pedestrian and passanger fatalities are here in the repository and the findings and write up for the pedestrian fatalities in Texas is over at my website adaviano2.edublogs.org. There you can find the 2 write ups for the state of Texas. One was for pedestrian deaths in crashes and the other was for multiple fatal crashes that occur on Texas roadways. Both of those were important outcomes that were to be explored. The pedestrian fatalities in crashes code is in R and the multiple fatalities is completed in Python.

Another project that looked at the multiple fatality crash data around the United States was also undertaken and the write up is on my blog site. This project looked at interesting data to help predict what may contribute to multiple fatality crashes around the United States. The results wer very similar to the Texas specific results with slight differences. This can be seen by looking at both projects and understanding the feature importance analysis completed at the end of both. 

Two of the Three write ups can be found at adaviano2.edublogs.org
