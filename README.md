# FARS-Texas-Crash-Data-Exploration
This repository is about my exploration of the Texas crash Data from FARS. this was a real world project.

Conclusion were made at the end of the data. this was an exploration of pedestrian fatalities in the state of Texas as they pertained to the crash data for that state recently. We find some interesting insight int owhat factors are most important contributers to the overall deaths. The code is here in the repository and the findings and write up are over at my website adaviano2.edublogs.com. There you can find the 2 write ups for the state of Texas. One was for pedestrian deaths in crashes and the other was for multiple fatal crashes. Both of those were important outcomes that were to be explored. The pedestrian fatalities in crashes code is on Python and the multiple fatalities is completed in R.
